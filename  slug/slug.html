          <p class="interactive-text">
            In 2020, amid widespread hygiene product shortages, a friend and I wondered — in our hyper-designed world, where every product competes for attention, why had bar soap been left behind? While most everyday objects had been reimagined as statement pieces, soap remained surprisingly stagnant — creative in scent and color, but stuck in its traditional shape.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            A couple of years later, as I began teaching myself design software (Adobe Suite, Blender) more seriously, that question came back. I wanted to build something tangible that tied together everything I was learning: product design, branding, 3D modeling, motion design, web development. This was the genesis of Slug.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Over the course of this project, I've designed and produced six distinct soap bars, each with different functional considerations. Beyond the physical products, I also developed a cohesive visual system that bridges digital and craft aesthetics, and an e-commerce platform. I've sold over 500 bars through select San Francisco retailers and direct-to-consumer channels.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text">

          <p class="interactive-text">
            The Slug 2024-2025 collection consists of six distinct forms, each addressing specific design challenges within the constraints of a functional hygiene product. Working with glycerin-based materials allowed me to explore transparency, color, and sculptural possibilities while maintaining the core requirements of effective cleansing and longevity.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>PACKAGING</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Each soap comes in a minimalist off-white box with embossed elements: the snail logo on front and 'slug' on bottom. Opening reveals a vibrant green interior featuring the full Slug character set. The soap itself is wrapped in certified compostable wax paper, creating a deliberate unboxing experience that mirrors the unexpected nature of the products.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>MYSTERY SOAP</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Mystery Soap marked the beginning of Slug Soap's design exploration. Initially inspired by insect lollipops and resin paperweights, these transparent bars contain objects suspended within them — transforming ordinary items into art. Each bar features raised typography spelling 'slug' in custom block letters, adding both brand recognition and tactile feedback. As the soap wears down, the interplay between smooth surfaces and dimensional text creates evolving grip zones that change throughout the product's lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>CHEESE SOAP</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            The Cheese Soap emerged from user research highlighting the primary failure point of traditional soap: poor grip when wet. Its wedge form directly references Swiss cheese, with characteristic holes serving as intuitive grip points and visual markers. I spent considerable time determining optimal hole placement to maintain structural integrity while maximizing lathering surface area. The triangular profile naturally fits palm contours, while flat faces provide stable storage surfaces.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>SHELL SOAP</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Shell Soap represents the collection's most complex geometric challenge. Based on logarithmic spirals found in gastropod shells, the form required multiple prototyping iterations to achieve the correct coil ratio. The spiral creates natural drainage channels while offering multiple grip orientations. Each color variant was matched with complementary scents — pink with rose, blue with ocean — establishing a connection between visual and olfactory experiences. The decreasing radius ensures ergonomic properties remain consistent as the soap diminishes.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>STAR SOAP</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Star Soap explores form and function through five-pointed geometry enhanced with phosphorescent material. The glow-in-the-dark element adds an interactive quality while the vertices provide natural grip points. The central mass maintains adequate surface area for lathering, and the rotational symmetry means there's no wrong way to hold it — addressing common frustrations with directional soap designs.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>GRIP SOAP</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Grip Soap represents the most technically driven design in the collection. Its faceted geometry features precisely angled ridges optimized for wet-hand friction. The embossed Slug logo on the front face serves triple duty: brand identification, additional grip texture, and visual orientation indicator. The charcoal variant incorporates production remnants from other soaps, creating a zero-waste option with unique marbled patterns while maintaining identical functional properties.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>MERCH</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Beyond soap, I developed a merchandise line that extends the Slug brand into everyday objects. The collection includes screen-printed t-shirts featuring the pixelated snail logo and supporting illustrations, stainless steel water bottles with etched designs, and vinyl sticker sheets showcasing the full cast of Slug characters. Each piece maintains the brand's visual language while serving as functional items that customers can integrate into their daily routines. The merchandise creates additional touchpoints for brand engagement beyond the bathroom.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>PRODUCTION PROCCESS</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Each design required developing custom molds using 3D printing and silicone casting techniques. Production involves precise temperature control and timing for consistent results. I adjust material formulation by design — the Star Soap requires increased hardness for point retention, while the Shell Soap needs flexibility for curved surfaces. This iterative process of prototyping, testing, and refinement continues to inform new variations and improvements.

          <p class="interactive-text">
            For Slug Soap's e-commerce platform, I focused on creating a streamlined interface that prioritizes product discovery while maintaining essential brand elements. The site architecture reflects the same balance of simplicity and surprise found in the physical products.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>Information Architecture</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            The site employs a split-screen layout with scrollable product catalog on the left and fixed navigation on the right. This approach keeps products front and center while ensuring key functions remain accessible. Each product card follows a consistent template: hero image, detailed description, and prominent 'Add to Cart' button, separated by subtle dividers for visual clarity. The fixed sidebar contains company information, navigation links, and social media connections, creating a persistent brand presence without overwhelming the shopping experience.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>Responsive Strategy</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            On mobile devices, the layout adapts through a fundamental restructuring rather than simple scaling. The fixed sidebar elements migrate to a sticky header, maintaining functional parity while optimizing for touch interactions. Product cards expand to full width with larger tap targets, and the cart interface slides in from the right to preserve screen real estate. This responsive approach ensures consistent functionality across devices while acknowledging the different interaction patterns of desktop and mobile users.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>Visual Design</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            The interface extends the brand's pixel aesthetic through subtle grid alignments and monospaced typography. Product photography maintains consistent lighting and background treatment to create visual cohesion within the catalog. Hover states on desktop reveal additional product angles, while mobile users can swipe through images. The minimal color palette allows product colors to dominate, with interface elements using only neutral tones and the brand's signature green for interactive elements.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Built on a lightweight framework prioritizing performance, the site loads quickly despite image-heavy content. Lazy loading prevents unnecessary bandwidth usage, while optimized images maintain quality at minimal file sizes. The cart system uses session storage to preserve selections without requiring accounts, reducing friction in the purchase process. Payment integration through Stripe enables secure transactions while maintaining the streamlined aesthetic.
          </p>

            The motion work for Slug Soap explores how animation can communicate brand personality and product qualities through various techniques and platforms.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>3D Product Visualization</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            Using Blender, I created rotating product renders that showcase each soap's dimensional qualities. These animations emphasize the unique characteristics of each design — the Shell Soap spirals as it rotates, the Star Soap's points catch light at different angles, and the Mystery Soap's transparency reveals embedded objects from multiple perspectives. The consistent lighting setup and rotation speed across all products creates a cohesive catalog while highlighting individual features.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>Brand Animation</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            In After Effects, I developed animated versions of the Slug logo and supporting graphics. The pixelated snail animates through a frame-by-frame sequence that references early video game sprites, reinforcing the digital craft aesthetic. Supporting characters appear through various transition effects: mushrooms grow from single pixels, trees branch out algorithmically, and the snail leaves a subtle trail as it moves. These animations appear in social media content and email campaigns.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text"><strong>Process Documentation</strong></p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            I produced time-lapse videos documenting the soap-making process, from mixing glycerin to demolding finished products. These behind-the-scenes glimpses, edited with minimal color grading to maintain authenticity, help customers understand the craft involved in each bar. The documentation serves both marketing and educational purposes, demystifying the production process while building trust in the brand's handmade claims.
