            Fox & Lion Bread is a bakery in San Francisco's Mission District (3350 18th St) known for its bread, pastries, coffee, and curated wine selection. They brought me on to design and develop an interactive website to highlight their wine offerings and bring greater visibility to their drink program.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            My objective was to translate the warmth and character of their physical space into a digital experience that felt true to the brand. Drawing inspiration from the shop's interior — from the carefully stocked fridges and wire wine shelves to the plants thoughtfully placed throughout — I created a site that integrates illustrated replicas of these details, including their signature Fox & Lion chair and fridge displays.
          </p>
          <p class="interactive-text">
            This project combined visual design, digital illustration, and web development to create an interactive experience that not only showcased their wine selection but also extended the inviting, handcrafted feel of their bakery into an online environment.

            To bring the space to life online, I recreated this corner of the store in Three.js. I used Meshy to generate the initial 3D models, then refined them in Blender and recreated most of the textures in Illustrator for a more realistic look. The result is an experience that closely mirrors walking into Fox & Lion Bread.
